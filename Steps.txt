Step 1: Prepare Your Flask Application

Step 2: Create Lambda Layers
*We can create the lambda layer by uploading a zip file(eg - dependencies.zip) which containes all the necessary libraries 
that you need to run your flask application.

Step 3: Create the Lambda Function-
*In the AWS Lambda console, create a new Lambda function.
*Set the runtime to Python (e.g., Python 3.8 or later).
*In the function code section, upload your Flask application code (e.g., main.py) along with any other necessary files.
*Add the Lambda Layer you created in Step 2 to your Lambda function. This attaches the Flask dependencies.

Step 4: Configure API Gateway
*In the AWS API Gateway console, create a new API.
*Create a new resource and method (e.g., POST) that corresponds to your Flask application's endpoint.
*Configure the integration type to "Lambda Function" and select the Lambda function created in Step 3.
*Deploy the API to create a stage.

Step 5: Testing and Deployment
*Test your Flask application by invoking the API Gateway endpoint URL.
*Ensure that your Flask routes are correctly mapped to the API Gateway paths.
*If everything works as expected, you can now deploy your Flask application by sharing the API Gateway endpoint URL.
